# text-based-forum
A text based forum similar to 4chan 

This code provides a basic menu-driven interface with three options:

1. Create a new post: Prompts the user to enter a new post and stores it in the `posts$()` array.
2. View all posts: Displays all the stored posts in the `posts$()` array.
3. Exit: Terminates the program.

 QBasic is an outdated language, and modern web applications like 4chan require more advanced programming languages and frameworks to develop. The code provided above is just a basic representation to simulate a simple forum-like interface.
 
 the Python programming language and the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface. The application consists of a main window with two frames: one for creating new posts and another for viewing all posts.

Users can enter their name and the content of their post in the input fields provided. When the "Create" button is clicked, a new post is created and displayed in the listbox below. The listbox is scrollable using a scrollbar. The application also performs basic input validation to ensure that both the author and content fields are filled before creating a post.

Note that this is still a simplified version and lacks many features found in a full-fledged forum application. Implementing more complex functionality, such as user registration, thread creation, moderation, and real-time updates, would require additional programming logic, database integration, and potentially the use of web development frameworks
